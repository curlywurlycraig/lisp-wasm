# A lisp that compiles to WASM

This repo serves as a place to experiment with ideas surrounding the creation of a little lisp that compiles to WASM.

## Goals and principles

1. JS interop: Objects and arrays should work as expected across the ABI
2. Speed: Compilation and execution should be as fast as possible
3. Expressiveness: 

Some extra ideas and notes can be found in the orgfiles.
